There are three ways that you can participate with Seattle Creative Code.

### 1. Joining slack

Our slack is an open-invite slack. You can

After joining, post an introduction in **#general** and show off some of your work in **#humblebrag**.

### 2. Join us for Seattle Open Lab

**Seattle Open Lab** is a semimonthly zoom call (for now) where artists and creators
get together and hang out and talk about art, movement, creative coding and
whatever else comes up.

<Event event={fromQuery(props.data.allMdx.nodes[0])} />

### 3. Join our mailing list

If you want to stay up to date on things like events and other happenings,
you can join our low-volume mailing list by filling out the form below.

<MailingListSignup />

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    allMdx(filter: { slug: { eq: "seattle-open-lab" } }) {
      nodes {
        internal {
          type
        }
        frontmatter {
          repetition
          time
          link
          date
          title
        }
